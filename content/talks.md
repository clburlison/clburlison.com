### Bug Reporting Best Practices

July 20th, 2016

No one likes bugs, however they are the unfortunate reality that we must deal with in the Digital Age. When issues do arise in software it is often your job, as an administrator, to provide these details back to developers. Bug reports are your direct line of communication to developers for issues and regrettably when this process is done incorrectly it can leave both parties dissatisfied. This presentation takes a quick look at the importance of bug reports, the lifespan of a report and provides general tips that are useful for submitting future reports.
