title: Hack The Mac 2015
---

I almost missed Hack the Mac this year but luckily Twitter let me know once it had already started. Since I showed up late, I missed the first project overview and needed to go back to the video on demand to review what was said. While I was watching I thought it might be useful for others if I compiled a short overview with video links.  

All three projects were already brought to my attention before the event but here is my take away after watching the event:

* NBICreator can queue build jobs (I've already build multiple NBIs).

* I managed to use Recipe Robot to create a new recipe with little to no effort, output recipe was [AutoImagrNBI](https://github.com/autopkg/clburlison-recipes/tree/master/AutoImagrNBI).

* Zentral has also been on my radar for a few weeks but I've yet to do anything besides read through the docs. Hoping to spin up a docker instance soonâ„¢ (eventually). It. Looks. Awesome!

### NBICreator

<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/77932147#to00:09:25">![](/images/2015-10-19/nbi.png)</a>

  > NBICreator is a NetInstall image creation tool for OS X written in Objective-C.
  >
  > The following NetInstall images are currently supported:
  >
  > * NetInstall
  > * DeployStudio
  > * Imagr
  > * Casper (Alpha)
  >
  > The design and idea of the application is to be able to create different types of NetInstall images in one single application, and to save the configuration in a template to be reused when the NetInstall image need to be updated for newer versions of the OS.

### Recipe Robot

<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/77932147#to00:24:12">![](/images/2015-10-19/robot.png)</a>

  > Recipe Robot is the easiest way to create new AutoPkg recipes for simple Mac apps. It consists of two components:
  >
  > * A [Python script](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot#python-script-usage) that takes various types of input and automatically outputs AutoPkg recipes.
  >
  > * A [native Mac app](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot#mac-app-usage) that puts a friendly face on the Python script and makes it as simple as dragging and dropping. You can [download the latest version of the app here](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/releases/latest).
  >
  > This two-pronged approach allows AutoPkg novices to easily create recipes that follow community-accepted guidelines, and still provides a command-line tool for more advanced AutoPkg users. Also, using Python for program logic fosters community contribution to this project.

### Zentral

<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/77932147#to00:32:45">![](/images/2015-10-19/zentral.png)</a>

  > [Zentral](https://github.com/zentralopensource/zentral) is a new open-source project initiated by Apfelwerk in Summer/Fall 2015. Zentral combines [osquery](https://osquery.io/)'s powerful endpoint inventory features with a flexible notification and action framework. This enables one to identify and react to changes on OS X and Linux clients. Zentral consolidates the osquery information with inventory data from client management suites, e.g. JAMF Casper Suite and Sal. All details and events stored in a full text search engine.
