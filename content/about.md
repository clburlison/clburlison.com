👋 I'm Clayton Burlison. Currently, I am a Mac System Engineer for AppDynamics.

It looks like you stumbled across my blog so hopefully you can find
something helpful. If you want to reach out please message me via email,
twitter or on the [MacAdmin's Slack](https://macadmins.herokuapp.com). I
have the same username everywhere so it shouldn't be hard to find me.

Code license located [here](/docs/license/).

# Personal Life

Besides work, I graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with a
Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. In my free time I enjoy playing
video games and if you could not guess it from the site favicon I really
enjoy running.

# My list

This is a simple list I use to keep up with my goals. I host it on this site
to share and hopefully give others motivation to reach for their goals.
It also helps keep me held responsible since everyone in the world can see.
To see my current visit [my-list](/about/my-list/).

# Site Comments

Feel free to use comments as a way for feedback, corrections, further
discussion, etc. It is silly to put this in writing but be respectful and
that should cover all the bases. I reserve the final say on all comments.
