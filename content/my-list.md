_*Last Modified: {{< last_modified >}}*_

This page lists some goals I am working on or have completed. I have kept many to-do lists, including the original, which started as a private Facebook note in high school. Since then, my list has transformed between various digital and paper mediums into the current format you see today. Keeping these items in public is a nice way to share while holding myself semi-accountable.

## Current focus

1. Write one blog a month between July - Dec in 2023
1. Read two books in 2023

The idea behind having a current focus section is to disregard everything else on this page. It is too easy to become stretched too thin or overwhelmed trying to manage everything. My goal is to limit this area to less than five.
