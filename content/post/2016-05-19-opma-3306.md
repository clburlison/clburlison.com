Java! Currently, I am taking an Operating Management class which uses an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application. The instructions given to my peers consistents of:

* Download this file
* Download one of these two other files (no notes on how to use either config file)
* Open this jar file
* and a PS note that you need the Java SDK installed

Okay fine I can deal with bad setup instructions...then I got an error message and gave up.

## Instructions

If I couldn't get this to work and I'm an INSY major I know it wouldn't be very straight forward for non-INSY majors. With that said it isn't very hard to install the SAP software on a Mac. Steps below:

1. Use the download instructions from your instructor to download the latest `PlatinGUI740MacOSX_5.JAR` installer file.

1. Make sure and also download the `Landscape.xml` file.

    ![config file](/images/2016-05-19/config-file.png)

1. Now download the latest Java JDK from, [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

    ![Java JDK](/images/2016-05-19/java-jdk.png)

1. You now have all the requirements!

1. Install the Java JDK. It's a standard Apple package.

1. Now double click your JAR installer file. If it doesn't launch and shows a security prompt try again this time this time holding the 'control' key.

1. Once the installer works it should look like below. Click through the installer to install the SAP application.

    ![config file](/images/2016-05-19/sap-installer.png)

1. Now copy your `Landscape.xml` file to `/Applications/SAP Clients`

    ![config file](/images/2016-05-19/copy-config-file.png)

1. Lastly, we need to configure the client to use the xml file. Launch the SAPGUI application. The initial screen shown below.

    ![config file](/images/2016-05-19/first-screen.png)

1. Now open your SAPGUI preferences.

    ![config file](/images/2016-05-19/app-prefs.png)

1. Under Configuration > Logon. Add your 'SAP UI Landscape' file path (shown below). Make sure and click 'Apply' in the bottom.

    ```
    file:/Applications/SAP%20Clients/SAPUILandscape.xml
    ```

    ![config file](/images/2016-05-19/pref-setup.png)

1. Now at the main menu change the dropdown to 'Local'

    ![config file](/images/2016-05-19/dropdown.png)

You'll now have a list of all the servers. If you're in my class you'll want to double click the 'Torino' server. From here you should be able to use the SAP application on your mac.



## Generic Error
If you received the generic error message below,

![java error](/images/2016-05-19/jarjarjar.png)

the fix I used was to delete the JavaAppletPlugin. You can do this by navigating to `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/` and moving `JavaAppletPlugin.plugin` to the trash can.

![java plugin](/images/2016-05-19/plugin-path.png)

Now try launching the Jar file and see if the installer works.
