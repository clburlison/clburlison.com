Alerts are a useful feature that add side content such as tips, notes, or warnings to your articles. They are especially handy when writing educational tutorial-style articles. Use the corresponding shortcodes to enable alerts inside your content:

    {{%/* notice info */%}}
    Here's a info...
    {{%/* /notice */%}}

All four styles below:

{{< notice note >}}
Here is a note...
{{< /notice >}}

{{< notice tip >}}
Here is a tip...
{{< /notice >}}

{{< notice info >}}
Here is an info...
{{< /notice >}}

{{< notice warning >}}
Here is a warning...
{{< /notice >}}
