### Bug Reporting Best Practices
July 20th, 2016

No one likes bugs, however they are the unfortunate reality that we must deal with in the Digital Age.

This presentation takes a quick look at the importance of bug reports, the lifespan of a report and provides general tips that are useful for submitting future reports.
