title: Moving to Plain Jekyll
---

Moved the blog over from Octopress to a plain Jekyll setup. This allows me to have a bit more control while also removing some of the fluff that was installed by Octopress that I did not use. I am very glad to have found such a great theme created by Michael Rose. I will release another post once I have had a little more time to play around. As of this moment, it is about 10 times faster to generate the website on my laptop. The ``--watch`` flag from raw jekyll much faster at recreating pages.

Still need to add tags and a few other plugins.
