Apple has some pretty nice energy savings options built into macOS. Most of these options are tucked nicely inside of the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences.

![Energy Saver Panel](/images/2016-10-10/EnergySaver.png)

The above settings get written to the `com.apple.AutoWake` preference and looks like:

```bash
defaults read /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.AutoWake
{
    RepeatingPowerOff =     {
        eventtype = shutdown;
        time = 1020;
        weekdays = 127;
    };
    RepeatingPowerOn =     {
        eventtype = wakepoweron;
        time = 420;
        weekdays = 31;
    };
}

```


# Weekdays

Some of these values are a bit opaque once they are written to the preferences domain. For example, when you set the `Every Day` option in the above screenshot this value is written in the `weekdays` key with a value of `127`. So what does that value actually refer to? Each day gets a value starting from one that doubles with each passing day.

```
Weekdays values

  1 - Monday
  2 - Tuesday
  4 - Wednesday
  8 - Thursday
  16 - Friday
  32 - Saturday
  64 - Sunday
```

To select every day of the week you add all of the values together: `1+2+4+8+16+32+64 = 127`. While weekdays would be: `1+2+4+8+16 = 31`. The math is quite simple but easy to forget that this specific aspect of the system starts the day on Monday.

# Time

The `time` value is configured as time after 00:00, or midnight, in seconds. Examples below:

```
4 am
  60m x 4h = 240s

1:30 pm
  60m x 13.5h = 810s

5:00 pm
  60m x 17h = 1020s
```

# Profile

If you have gotten this far you might be wondering why any of the information above matters? If you have ever needed to create a configuration profile for Energy Saver, understanding these values allow you to customize the options without having to use a GUI like Profile Manager.

```xml
<key>com.apple.EnergySaver.desktop.Schedule</key>
<dict>
	<key>RepeatingPowerOff</key>
	<dict>
		<key>eventtype</key>
		<string>shutdown</string>
		<key>time</key>
		<integer>1200</integer>
		<key>weekdays</key>
		<integer>127</integer>
	</dict>
	<key>RepeatingPowerOn</key>
	<dict>
		<key>eventtype</key>
		<string>wakepoweron</string>
		<key>time</key>
		<integer>420</integer>
		<key>weekdays</key>
		<integer>31</integer>
	</dict>
</dict>
```

# Random
The `RepeatingPowerOff` > `eventtype` string actually accepts three types: `restart`, `sleep`, and `shutdown`. Unfortunately the system will only read one `RepeatingPowerOff` dict. That means you are unable to get creative and say restart Monday-Friday at 8pm and shutdown Saturday-Sunday at 3pm.
